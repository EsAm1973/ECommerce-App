# ECommerce-App

The ECommerce app showcases a variety of products, allowing you to save your favorite items in the Favorites section and add products to the cart for purchase.

## Usage

To use the application, please follow these instructions:

1. **Signup**:
   - When using the Signup feature, fill in your details and sign in as usual.
   - Note that your data will not be saved on the server because the API used does not allow the registration of new users.
   - Despite this, the API will return a response with a status code 200, indicating that your registration process is correct, even though your data is not persisted.

2. **Login**:
   - In order to be able to log in to the program, you must use the username and password provided by this [API response](https://fakestoreapi.com/users).
   - Choose any of the usernames and corresponding passwords from the response to log in successfully.
